Webscrape of Whiskey Exchange to get all brands of whiskey on the site in a dataset

## What does it do

Drams scrapes the [Whiskey Exchange](https://www.thewhiskyexchange.com/) for lists of all brands of whiskey on the site and puts them into a CSV dataset for public use.

This scraper divides the data into their respective geographic location, with Scotch being broken down by type.

I also plan on scraping [Master of Malt](https://www.masterofmalt.com/) to get any whiskeys that are not currently listed on the Whiskey Exchange.

### Types

- Scotch
  - Single Malt
  - Blended Malt
  - Grain
  - Blended
- Irish
- Canadian
- Japanese
- American
- Other

Currently, there are **2,622 whiskeys** from **568 distilleries**
